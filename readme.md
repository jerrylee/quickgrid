# Jerrys Simple Grid

I am building this very simple grid for when I don't need all the joys of Bootstrap. It is desktop first, and follows a lot of the bootstrap ways. 

## Use of this grid

Well, I am sure you have used grids for a while, so this should be easy, it has a container for an outer container of content, rows, and columns(column-1, column-2, etc.) You have to have a total of 12 columns to make a total row.
